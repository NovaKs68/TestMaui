# TestMaui

The aim of this project is to highlight a display problem in MAUI with the Mopup library.

Steps that work :
1. Using the buttons on the main page, open a Shell **Page**.
2. In this page, open a Mopup dialog.
3. It is visible with its green background.

Steps with problems :
1. Using the buttons on the main page, open a Shell **Modal**.
2. In this modal, open a dialog Mopup.
3. It opens behind the modal. Go back and you'll see the Mopup.
